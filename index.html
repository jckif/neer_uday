                    <p>The Rainwater Harvesting & Water Conservation Vertical is a flagship initiative under the Mission "NEER UDAY" Student Explorer Internship Program. It is led by the Jodhpur City Knowledge and Innovation Foundation (JCKIF) in collaboration with IIT Jodhpur and the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.</p>
                    <p>This vertical enables student teams to actively engage with rural communities, identify local water-related challenges, and develop sustainable rainwater harvesting and conservation strategies. Through these village visits, students gain hands-on experience while contributing to real-world solutions.</p>
                    <p>By combining field exploration, mapping, and data collection, the program creates a strong link between scientific research and grassroots action. Each report featured here captures valuable insights from the ground. Together, we aim to harness traditional knowledge and modern innovation to build a water-secure future.</p>
